Notes and ideas for the online course

From the proposal, the five modules are:

1. **Transparent research** (Andy) Collaborating and sharing code will deal with the foundational skill
of creating a transparent record of research using the versioning tool Git and the public website
GitHub.com. Increasingly scientists are called on to provide the code they used in their data
analysis or modelling (Stodden et al. 2013). Learners will be trained in the skills needed to
collaborate, share code publically, and generate reproducible research.

2. **Reproducible analysis with dynamic documents** (Andy) will cover the use of dynamic documents
that embed R code in a document using Rmarkdown. Dynamic documents allow quantitative
analysis to be easily communicated and replicated (Nosek & Errington 2020).

3. **Multivariate statistics** (Kim) will introduce techniques like cluster analysis and ordination for high
dimensional biological data that aid further analysis (e.g., Nguyen & Holmes 2019).

4. **Machine learning** (Kim) will survey machine learning techniques such as those used in image
recognition (Tabak et al. 2019), and include key skills such as cross-validation,

5. **Optimization techniques** (Brian) will introduce mathematical and computational optimization
methods that are used in applications ranging from experimental design (Braniff & Ingalls 2018) to standard model analysis.


## Timeline

Draft version up for early July, paying recruited testers July-Sept, each person would do one module. 
18k total - 10k Kim buyout = 8k.
Then revise and more broadly test.
Feb 2022 goes live.
